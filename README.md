This is my first project in both github and html 
The project consist of creating simple index website with HTML to display different food recipes.

I hope to advance this project with CSS and turn it from
a brutalist hellscape into a proper webpage.

Lessons learned: Making a website with just html is simple, the real effort comes from text entries. The rest of the effort appears to be via styles and functionality A.K.A CSS and JavaScript
