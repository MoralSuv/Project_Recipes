<!--Create an unorganized list with all the ingredients needed. I took some creative liberties with this one-->
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil, add soba noodles, and cook according to package directions, about 4 minutes. Drain noodles, rinse under cold water, and set aside to cool.</li>
        <li>Pour dressing over noodles. Add red bell pepper and toss to combine. Refrigerate until well chilled, at least 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Cut pork tenderloin into very thin slices, about 1/8 inch thick, then cut each slice in half. Add pork to marinade, cover bowl, and chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes or longer.</li>
        <li>Remove pork from refrigerator. Heat a skillet over medium-high heat, and heat the remaining 1 tablespoon sesame oil until hot. Add pork, separating pieces to cover the skillet's bottom. Cook the pork, occasionally stirring, until cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes. Your time will depend on how thinly the pork is cut, but try not to overcook to retain tenderness.</li>
        <li>Remove noodles from the refrigerator and give them a good stir. Divide the noodles among 4 plates or bowls. Evenly distribute the pork on top of the noodles and garnish with peanuts, green onion and sesame seeds before serving.</li>
    </ol>
